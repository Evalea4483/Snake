Snake Game in Java
This Java project implements a simple Snake game using the Swing library. The game features a snake that moves around the screen, consuming apples to grow longer. The player controls the snake's direction using arrow keys. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the screen boundaries.

Features:
Snake Movement: The snake moves in the direction specified by the player using arrow keys.

Apple Consumption: When the snake's head collides with an apple, the snake grows longer, and a new apple appears.

Collision Detection: The game checks for collisions with itself or the screen boundaries, ending the game if a collision occurs.

Instructions:
Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.

Try to consume apples to grow the snake and maximize your score.

Avoid collisions with the snake's own body or the screen edges.

Dependencies:
Java Development Kit (JDK)
Swing Library
